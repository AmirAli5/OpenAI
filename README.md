I recently completed an in-depth training on OpenAI's latest technologies, where I explored, practiced, and built applications using state-of-the-art AI models. This training provided hands-on experience in various AI capabilities, including text generation, multimodal AI, fine-tuning, and real-time chatbot development.

#### Key Learnings & Practical Implementations
✅ Completion & Chat Completion AI – Understanding prompt engineering, response optimization, and advanced conversation handling. <br>
✅ Function Calling API – Integrating AI with external APIs for dynamic and interactive applications. <br>
✅ Audio-to-Text (Whisper Model) – Converting speech into text with high accuracy. <br>
✅ Image-to-Text (DALL·E Model) – Generating and interpreting images using AI. <br>
✅ Fine-Tuning GPT – Training and customizing GPT models with domain-specific data. <br>
✅ Building a Telegram Bot – Implementing a real-world chatbot using OpenAI’s latest GPT models. <br>
